*Dear Mr./Mrs Co-Worker,*
		
*As you may know, we are in the middle of finalizing the application for ABC App.  I want to emphasize the importance on protecting our users information.  The adversaries we are to look out for are hackers who has interest in our users data.  To prevent from that to happen is to evaluate the attack surface and vector, specific attacks and risk our users face.*
  
*For example, the attack surface considers all paths and commands into and out of the application, how the code was written, where the valuable data such as secrets and keys are stored.  How would the hacker be able to gain acess to a computer or network by doing a specific payload or malicious outcome.  We must consider some of the common hacking techniques such as denial of service, phishing and man in the middle attacks.*

*We can meet in person if you want to discuss this further*

*Thanks.*
